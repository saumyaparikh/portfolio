              Hello! My name is Saumya Parikh and I'm pursuing a Bachelors's in
              Computer Engineering from Vidyavardhini College of Engineering and
              Technology, Mumbai University.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm a passionate learner who's always willing to learn and work
              across technologies and domains. I love to explore new
              technologies. I'm currently into Web Development and working on my
              Data Structures and Algorithms
            </p>
            <p>
              My interest in programming started back in 2016 when I had C,
              HTML/CSS in my class XI course. I started following
              web-development tutorials from YouTube, Udemy, Coursera and built
              some projects. Fast-forward to today, I can build a full-stack web
              application.
            </p>
            <p>
              At university, I learnt C++. For competitive programming and
              solving Data Structures - Algorithms problems, I use C++. Besides,
              I know Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, React, Django,
              Git.
